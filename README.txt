I wrote this pretty quickly so I'll have another go at fixing the broken elements myself tomorrow. The errors I'm aware of are (1) that the mission statement position is hardcoded (2) the nav links don't line up correctly (3) I couldn't get the space-around space-between functions to work in the .showcase and .locations.contain 

There also might be some inconsistent fonts and mispellings but I do know how to fix those if I had more time.

Thanks for your Patience,
Sam
